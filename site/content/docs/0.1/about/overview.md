Scoutstrap is a 'theme' that can be applied on-top of the Bootstrap UI framework. In reality - we take Bootstraps source code and apply our 'scouty' styles and re-package the whole project, building on the good work of those on the Bootstrap project.

Originally built by [rglss](https://github.com/rglss) as he got fed of having to build style sheets that met the new Scout brand guidelines, hopefully other people find it useful and contribute!
